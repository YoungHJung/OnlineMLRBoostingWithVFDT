# Online Multi-label Ranking Boosting
A Python implementation of online multi-label ranking boosting using VFDT as weak learners. 

The algorithms are described and theoretically analayzed in the following work.

Online Boosting Algorithms for Multi-label Ranking.

If you use this code in your paper, please cite the above work. Although it is based on this we cannot guarantee that the algorithm will work exactly, or even produce the same output, as any of these implementations.

For our weak learners, we used the VFDT proposed and implemented by the following two works.

The folders "core" and "ht", and the file "hoeffdingtree.py" are copied from the above works, and only minor changes are made to be compatible in python 2.7 (The original code was written in python 3.x). 

The folder "data" contains five data sets from MULAN. (see http://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets.html)
